                <li>Engine: Zetec NA I4 2.0-litre carburated four-cylinder with 170 hp and 144 lb-ft</li>

            <p>The Focus ST170 was Fordâ€™s first hot hatch to wear the ST badge, and it may look familiar because we received it stateside as the Focus SVT.</p>
            <p>Powered by a naturally aspirated 2.0-liter Zetec engine with a host of upgrades, it delivered 170 hp and loved to rev.</p>
            <p>Mated to an excellent six-speed manual transmission and featuring understated but attractive looks among other changes, it set the bar at which all following performance Focus ST models would be judged.</p>
            <p>It's just too bad the Focus SVT never received the extra five-door and wagon body styles the ST170 did.</p>
