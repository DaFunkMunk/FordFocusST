        <div id="stats" class="container">

            <ul class="generations">
                <li>Focus ST</li>
                <li>Engine: 2.0-litre turbo four-cylinder with 252 hp and 270 lb-ft</li>
                <li>Transmission: Six-speed manual</li>
                <li>Front-wheel drive</li>
                <li>0-100km/h: 6.5 seconds</li>
            </ul>

            <p>With the Volvo connection severed in 2010, Ford decided to go in-house with its engine.</p>
            <p>While the car lost of bit of aural character, the four-cylinder turbo was more powerful and lighter to boot.</p>
            <p>Ford turned up the wick on the styling, too. The front-end, especially on the pre-facelift models, stood out with cleaner styling thanks to the deleted upper grille and a large mesh grille placed further down the front fascia.</p>
            <p>In addition to lowered suspension, the ST was also fitted with 18-inch wheels wrapped in 235/40 rubber, and Recaro seats.

                As always, the European ST menu was a little fuller with the option of a tax- and wallet-friendly 2.0-litre diesel with 138kW and 400Nm, and the availability of a wagon variant.</p>
