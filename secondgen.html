            <p>The third-gen Focus ST was the first time the ST nameplate went global. Gone was SVT, so Ford decided to give Americans a taste of ST, and the third-generation Focus was the perfect platform to do it, </p>
            <p>because it was not only larger than its predecessors but offered better performance thanks to the 2.0-liter EcoBoost under the hood, developed from the Mazda L engine, but with direct injection and a turbocharger, making a healthy 252 horsepower.</p>
            <p>Along with a body kit, new wheels, suspension tuning, and a six-speed manual transmission, it was one of the best performance hatchback options on the market, but once again, it's a shame we never received the wagon or sedan versions that our counterparts did.</p>
